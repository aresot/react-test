Build flight results controller:

- overall layout for the controller:

<img src="images/screen1.png"/>

- implement flight card close to this design (see properties below to match UI values). Use first flight segment to display airline logo and name 



- JSON structure for each option:
airline Logo URL: option.flight.flightSegments[0].highResAirlineLogoUr.l
airline name: option.flight.flightSegments[0].airlineName
departure date/time: option.flight.flightSegments[0].departureDateAndTime
departure airportCode: option.flight.flightSegments[0].departureAirportCode
arrival date/time: option.flight.flightSegments[option.flight.flightSegments.length-1].arrivalDateAndTime
arrival airportCode: option.flight.flightSegments[option.flight.flightSegments.length-1].arrivalAirportCode
number of stops: option.flight.flightSegments.length-1
duration: option.flight.durationMinutes (duration of flight in minutes)
price: option.priceInfo.totalPrice

- implement filters for the list of flights (show only airlines that are present in the flight options):
Use airlineName/airlineCode in the first segment to use for Airline filter
